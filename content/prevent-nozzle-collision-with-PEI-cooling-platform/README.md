The Qidi Plus 4 Printer must clean its nozzle to properly sense nozzle touch against print bed during automatic bed leveling. Part of that process is cooling and rubbing the nozzle tip against a small PEI plaste mounted upon a spring loaded platform just to the right of "poop" ejector. If the PEI platform is too high, nozzzle tip quite forcefully impacts against the platform. This is has been witnessed to snap nozzle ceramic heat breaks. Three out of four Plus 4 printers here had their PEI platforms set too high. 

Fortunately, heights of left and right edges of the PEI platform can be independently adjusted via two screws. The two screws are hidden underneath the small PEI plate.


Pry off the PEI cooling plate. It is only held in place by adhesive.
