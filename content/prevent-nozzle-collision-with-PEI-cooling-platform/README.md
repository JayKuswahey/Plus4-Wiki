# Prevent Nozzle Collisions Against PEI Nozzle Cooling Platform.

The Qidi Plus 4 Printer must clean its nozzle to properly sense nozzle touch against print bed during automatic bed leveling. Part of that process is cooling and rubbing  nozzle tip against a small PEI plate mounted upon a spring loaded, elevated platform. The elevated platform is just to the right of "poop" ejector. If the platform sits too high, nozzle tip quite forcefully crashes against left edge of platform. This impact has been witnessed to snap ceramic heat breaks. Three out of four Plus 4 printers here had their PEI platforms set high enough to create notching of the platform where the nozzle had been striking. Fortunately, I had not yet suffered a fractured ceramic heat break.

We can prevent hard nozzle strikes by adjusting height and slope of the PEI platform. Left and right edges of the PEI platform are independently adjustable via two screws. The two screws are hidden underneath the small PEI plate. Our goal is to make the nozzle tip smoothly get onto the left edge of PEI plate, yet still rub against center of PEI plate.



## Steps to Adjust PEI Platform


1. Turn off printer power so you can manually move the toolhead.

2. Pry off the PEI cooling plate
This is readily done with a thin pry tool. Plate is only held in place by adhesive.

3. Adjust Height Screws


You wil see two screws that were hidden under the PEI cooling plate. Left screw sets left height of platform. Right screw sets right height. We want to lower the left edge enough for the nozzle tip to barely clear. We set the right edge about 0.75 mm higher so the nozzle tip makes contact against PEI plate before it reaches center of plate.


Gently move nozzle tip across the left edge of the platform to feel and see how the tip engages the platform. Adjust left height screw until nozzle tip just barely clears the left platform edge. You should not feel resistance as the nozzle tip enters the elevated platform. Right height should be set about 0.75 mm. This slightly slopes the platform so the nozzle will contact the PEI plate as nozzle moves rightward. 




4. Replace PEI Plate and Verify Fit

Once you have heights adjusted, put the PEI plate back on and verify how the tip interacts with PEI plate. The nozzle should cleanly and effortless glide onto left edge of PEI plate. As you move the nozzle further right, it should engage the PEI plate. Verify it is actually touching by moving the toolhead forwards and backwards slightly. That will shift the PEI plate and its platform if the nozzle is in actual contact. Should heights need further adjustment, remove PEI plate once more to access the screws.



## CAUTIONS

ALWAYS MOVE TOOLHEAD BACK TO CENTER OF BED BEFORE TURNING PRINTER ON
If you leave the toolhead all the way to the rear and to the right of the PEI platform, the nozzle will forcefully strike right edge of platform as printer attempts XY homing.

The adjustment screws thread into a pair of nylock nuts below them. This is the bottom view which is revealed by opening the rear of the printer and removing the "poop" chute. You don't need to see the nuts to adjust platform height. I show them here to warn against loosening the screws fully. You will detach the nut.





## DONE 
Your Plus 4 printer shoudl now be less prone to snapping its nozzle ceramic heat break.
