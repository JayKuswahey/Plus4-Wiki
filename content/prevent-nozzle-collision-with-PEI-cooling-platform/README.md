# Prevent Nozzle Collisions Against PEI Nozzle Cooling Platform.

The Qidi Plus 4 Printer must clean its nozzle to properly sense nozzle touch against print bed during automatic bed leveling. Part of that process is cooling and rubbing  nozzle tip against a small PEI plaste mounted upon a spring loaded platform. The elevated platform is just to the right of "poop" ejector. If that PEI platform sits too high, nozzzle tip very forcefully crashes against left edge of platform. This impact has been witnessed snapping nozzle ceramic heat breaks. Three out of four Plus 4 printers here had their PEI platforms set high enough to create notching of the platform where the nozzle had been striking it.

Fortunately, I had not yet suffered a fractured ceramic heat break.

We can prevent hard nozzle strikes by adjusting height of the PEI platform. Left and right edges of the PEI platform can be independently adjusted via two screws. The two screws are hidden underneath the small PEI plate. Goal is to make the nozzle tip smoothly get onto the left edge of PEI plate, but still rub against center of PEI plate.

Turn off printer power so you can manually move the toolhead.

Pry off the PEI cooling plate with a thin pry tool. Plate is only held in place by adhesive.

You wil see two screws that were hidden under the PEI cooling plate. The left screw sets left height of platform. The right screw sets right height. We want to lower the left edge just enough for the nozzle tip to clear. Leave the right edge about 0.75 mm higher so the nozzle tip makes contact against PEI plate before it travels to center of plate.

Gently move nozzle tip across the left edge of the platform and adjust left height screw until the tip just barely clears the left platform edge. You should not feel resistance as the nozzle tip enters the elevated platform. Right height should be higher by about 0.75 mm. That slightly slopes the PEI plate so the nozzle contacts it as nozzle moves rightward. 

Once you have the heights adjusted, put the PEI plate back on and recheck how the tip interacts with PEI plate. The nozzle should cleanly and effortless glide past left edge of PEI plate. As you move the nozzle further right, it should engage the PEI plate. Verify it is touching by moving the toolhead forwards and backwards slightly. That should move the PEI plate and its platform, if the nozzle is in contact.

The adjustment screws thread into a pair of nylock nuts below them. This is the bottom view which is revealed by opening the rear of the printer and removing the "poop" chute. You don't need to see the nuts to adjust platform height. I show them here to warn against loosening the screws fully. You will detach the nut.

## WARNING! BE SURE TO MOVE THE TOOLHEAD BACK TO CENTER OF BED BEFORE TURNING PRINTER ON
If you leave the toolhead in the rear and right of the PEI platform, the nozzle will forcefully strike right edge of platform when printer attempts XY homing.

Your Plus 4 printer shoudl now be less prone to snapping its nozzle ceramic heat break.
