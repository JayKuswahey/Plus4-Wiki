Qidi Plus 4 with Firmware 1.6.0 is able to support multiple USB cameras, but currently available instructions require use of SSh and/or installation of Crowsnest, or are incomplete regarding setting up URL's for cameras withing FLuidd. It's really fairly simple once one knows the steps.

1. Connect all your USB cameras and have printer Fluidd interface display in your browser.

2. Gather required USB device file path for each connected camera. You will use the file paths to specify each camera when creating your video streams.

3. Create video streams for each camera by specifying 1st camera in webcam.txt, 2nd camera in webcam2.txt, 3rd camera in webcam3.txt.

4. Add your newly created streams as cameras in Fluidd.
