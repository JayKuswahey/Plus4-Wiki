## Procedure

1. Use a clean cloth to wipe down all rods and screws, removing any dust or debris.
1. In the Klipper WebUI use the Tool >> Motors Off button to unlock the head. It can be moved by hand for the X/Y axis now.
1. [XY Axis Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwAsZDIng5w) - Apply a thin coat of oil (using a syringe with a 22Ga blunt tip will make this easier) on the X and Y rods and move the head back and forth to spread it. 
1. [Z Axis Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3oVYWs7v6c) - With the bed homed, apply a thin coat of lubricating grease on the Z lead screws and oil on the Z rods, then move the bed to a lower position. 
1. Apply another thin coat of grease and oil (if needed) and home the printer again.
1. If needed, you can repeat the movement process a few times to ensure the grease is evenly spread out.

- This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/190oyf6/comment/khf05hr/) has a lot of detail
- The official Qidi wiki has details on lubricating the rods and screws [here](https://wiki.qidi3d.com/en/X-Plus4/Manual/Maintenance-Manual) but caution is advised. We believe Qidi is recommending subpar lubricants that can cause damage to certain bearings.
