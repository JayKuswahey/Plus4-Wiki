## Procedure

1. In the Klipper WebUI use the Tool >> Motors Off button to unlock the head. It can be moved by hand for the X/Y axis now.
1. [XY Axis Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwAsZDIng5w) - Apply a thin coat of oil (using a syringe with a 22Ga blunt tip will make this easier) on the X and Y rods and move the head back and forth to spread it. 
1. [Z Axis Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V3oVYWs7v6c) - With the bed homed, apply a thin coat of lubricating grease (Z lead screws) and oil on the Z rods then move the bed to a lower position. 
1. Apply another thin coat of grease and oil (if needed) and home the printer again.
1. If needed, you can repeat the movement process a few times to ensure the grease is evenly spread out.
